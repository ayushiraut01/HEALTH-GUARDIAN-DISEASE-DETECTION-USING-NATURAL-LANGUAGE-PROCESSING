Health Guardian: Disease Detection Using NLP
Health Guardian is an AI-powered tool that uses Natural Language Processing (NLP) to detect diseases from user-given symptoms. The system analyzes symptoms, predicts possible diseases, and suggests related medicines, precautions, diets, and workouts. It helps users understand health concerns early and take action.

 Key Features
Disease Detection: Predicts possible diseases based on user-input symptoms.

Symptom Analysis: Uses NLP to understand and match symptoms.

Medicine Suggestions: Recommends medicines for the predicted disease.

Precautions & Tips: Offers helpful advice to manage or prevent diseases.

Data Files Used
precautions_df.csv: Disease and related precautions.

symptoms_df.csv: Symptoms mapped to diseases.

workout_df.csv: Exercises based on diseases.

Technologies Used
Python â€“ Main programming language

Pandas â€“ For data handling

NLP (NLTK / Spacy) â€“ To process symptom text

Flask â€“ To build the web app

Scikit-learn â€“ For machine learning model (Decision Tree)

ðŸ”® Future Improvements
Add better NLP models like BERT or GPT.

Use real-time health APIs.

Add user login and history tracking.
